# IodpWebWorkspace

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2. It is currently using Angular 12. There are 4 applications in this workspace:

### Auther
### crossrefupload
### DataCapture
### TemplateManager
### QCViewerTemplateManager

Most application specific configuration can be found in angular.json.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` followed by the project name for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Most project names are Pascal case and can be seen in the angular.json file. For example:

### `ng serve Auther` will serve Auther.
### `ng serve DataCapture` will serve Data Capture.


To serve multiple apps simultaneously, simply pass in a port parameter to any additional apps: `ng serve TemplateManager --port=4201`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project=Auther` to generate a new component for Auther. Change the project parameter to the name of your project. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build Auther` to build the Auther application. Replace `Auther` with the name of the project you want to build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
